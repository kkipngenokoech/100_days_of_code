welcome to my thirty days of reactjs.
here I am going to build a real world react app

    server-side searching

# FUNDAMENTALS OF REACT JS
for REACT appliactions you need to have node and NPM installed in your machine.
    to verify node version - node --version
    to verify npm version - npm --version
## SETTING UP A REACTJS PROJECT
command used - `npx create-react-app hacker-stories`
then cd into the directory `cd hacker-stories`
then run `npm start`
