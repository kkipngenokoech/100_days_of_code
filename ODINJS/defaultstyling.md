web injects some default css and styling into your web project.
## default styles.
An h1, for instance, is bigger and bolder than regular text. Links (a) are blue and underlined. Lists (ul and ol) both have a bunch of padding surrounding them. Browsers accomplish this by inserting a little bit of CSS into every webpage.

many developers start their projects with a “CSS Reset”; a file that undoes browser defaults, so that every element behaves the same in every browser.
