## BACKGROUND
this property is a shorthand of 8 different background-related properties.
Beyond changing background-colors, you can also specify background images, change the position and size of background images, and change how background images repeat or tile if they are too small to fill their container. It is also possible to have multiple background layers.

## BORDER
1. `border-property` - here you just need to define the style, color and size.
2. `border-radius` - s the property that is used to create rounded corners on things.


## box-shadow
adds a shadow effect around an element. This is useful to create a sense of depth on your page and to add subtle separation between elements.

## overflow
define what happens to an element when its content is too big to fit. The most common usage is likely to add scrollbars to an element inside a webpage, for example a card style element with scrollable content.
