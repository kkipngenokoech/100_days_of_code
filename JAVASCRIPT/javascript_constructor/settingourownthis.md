## call()

this is a method directly invoked onto a function.

we first pass into it a single value set as the value of  this, then we pass

## apply()

the apply() method is called on a function to not only invoke that function, but also to associate with it a specific value of this. However, rather than passing arguments one-by-one, separated by commas -- apply() takes the function's arguments in an array.
