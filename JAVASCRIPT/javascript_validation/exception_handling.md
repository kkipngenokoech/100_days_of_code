## exception handling in js
An exception signifies the presence of an abnormal condition which requires special operable techniques.

 exception handling is a process or method used for handling the abnormal statements in the code and executing them. It also enables to handle the flow control of the code/program. For handling the code, various handlers are used that process the exception and execute the code.

 ## types of errors
 1. syntax errors
    -   the way a programming language has to be written, its grammatical blueprint
2.  runtime errors
    - this is when an error runs during an execution of a program.
    - The codes which create runtime errors are known as Exceptions. Thus, exception handlers are used for handling runtime errors.
3. logical errors
    - An error which occurs when there is any logical mistake in the program that may not produce the desired output, and may terminate abnormally.
