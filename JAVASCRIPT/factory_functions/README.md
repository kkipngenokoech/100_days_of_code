## [FACTORY FUNCTIONS](./factoryfunctions.js)
Factory functions are used in place of constructors.

The factory function pattern is similar to constructors, but instead of using new to create an object, factory functions simply set up and return the new object when you call the function

N/B : you cannot use a arrow functions to create constructors
