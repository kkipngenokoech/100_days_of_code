javascript is added to a web page in four different ways:
    [inline script](./inline_scripting/index.html)
    [internal script](./internal_scripting/)
    [external script](./external_scripting/)
    multiple external scripts - you import the same way as internal scripting . One thing to note is that your main js file should be imported last.
