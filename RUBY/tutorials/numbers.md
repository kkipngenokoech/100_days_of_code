numbers are just numbers
they have the following math operators
 Addition : `1 + 1`
 Subtraction : `2 - 2`
 Multiplication : `3 * 3`
 Division : `10 / 5`
 Exponent : `2 ** 4`
 Modulus : `8 % 2`

there are two main types of numbers :
    integers - these are whole numbers
    floats -    these are numbers that contain a decimal point.
## converting number types
when you want to convert from integer to float:
    `13.to_f`
when you want to convert to integer from float:
    `13.05.to_i`
ruby doesn't round off, it just cuts the decimals off.

## useful number functions in ruby:
1. even
    - is a number even? `6.even?`
2. odd
    - is a number odd? `5.odd?`
