Ruby is an OOP language.
thus everything in ruby is an object
there are four basic data types:
    [numbers](./numbers.md) - (integers and floats)
    [strings](./strings.md)
    [symbols](./symbols.md)
    [Booleans](./Booleans.md)
Nil in Ruby represents nothing. everything in ruby has a return value. when a piece of ruby code doesn't return anything, it returns `nil`.
