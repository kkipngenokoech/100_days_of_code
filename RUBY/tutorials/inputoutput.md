To create programs that are user friendly and interactive, youâ€™ll need to know how to output data to a screen and how to get input from a user.

## output commands
to output in ruby you use `print` and `puts`
the difference between print and puts is that puts append a newline
both print and puts returns nil.

## input commands 
to accept inputs from the user you use `gets` command.
when we use gets command, the program stops and waits for user input.
when the user presses the `Enter` key the program will continue executing
gets returns the user input with a newline.
The gets command always returns a new line at the end of the input. 
`chomp` method is used to trim seperators.
