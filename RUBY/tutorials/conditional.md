## [if statement](./ruby_codes/conditionals.rb)
this is used to test conditionals.
the statement syntaxs used include:
    if statement
    if-else statement
    if -else if -statement
    ternary operators.
ternary operators - this is a way of shorthanding ruby  if else statements.s

## [case statement](./ruby_codes/switch.rb)
in ruby we use case instead of switch
The case statement matches one statement with multiple conditions just like a switch statement in other languages.

## [for loops](./ruby_codes/forloop.rb)
it iterates over a specific set of numbers.
it executes once for each element in execution

## [while loop](./ruby_codes/while.rb)
this is used when a number of iterations is not fixed.
it executes while a certain condition is still true.
once the condition becomes false, it stops executing.

## [do-while loop](./ruby_codes/dowhile.rb)
this will execute at least once since the conditions are written after the executing part

## [until loop](./ruby_codes/until.rb)
it runs until the given condition evaluates to true. it exits the loop when condition becomes true.
it is the opposite of the while loop since it only exits the loop when it becomes false(that is the while loop)

## [break loop](./ruby_codes/break.rb)
the ruby break statement is used to terminate a loop.
It is mostly used in while loop where value is printed till the condition is true, then break statement terminates the loop.

The break statement is called from inside the loop.
