welcome to the substrings project

## substring
takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

## method substring
it iterates over the string as it checks if it finds a match of the particular dictionary instance.
