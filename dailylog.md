# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 4th, 2022
##### (blueprint)

**Today's Progress**: identified the resources that will guide me do my first 30 days thats with django python

**Thoughts:** the first 30 days, I will do django based projects, then the next 30 days I will spent it doing react based projects, the other 30 I will spend doing ruby on rails based projects.

**Link to work:** [this is the blueprint](http://www.example.com)
